# Quick Reference: Chrome Password Alert Fix

## 🎯 Problem Fixed
Chrome password breach warnings appearing during automated tests, especially after the 2nd test run.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Updated Configuration File
**File**: `src/test/resources/boyka-config.json`

Added to the `test_web` configuration:

1. **Chrome Options** (8 new flags):
   - `--disable-features=PasswordLeakDetection`
   - `--disable-features=PasswordManager`
   - `--disable-features=AutofillPasswordGeneration`
   - `--disable-password-manager-reauthentication`
   - `--disable-save-password-bubble`
   - `--incognito` (Run tests in incognito mode)

2. **Browser Preferences** (4 settings):
   - `credentials_enable_service: false`
   - `profile.password_manager_enabled: false`
   - `profile.password_manager_leak_detection: false`
   - `autofill.profile_enabled: false`

## 🚀 How to Test

```powershell
# Run all tests
mvn clean test

# Run specific test
mvn test -Dtest=SauceDemoTests
```

## 📋 What Changed

### Before:
- Tests failed after 2nd run due to password alerts
- Manual Chrome settings didn't persist
- Password breach warnings interrupted automation

### After:
- Tests run in incognito mode (clean state)
- All password features disabled via code
- No manual Chrome configuration needed
- Consistent test execution

## 🔍 Verification

Check for these improvements:
- ✅ No "Password found in data breach" alerts
- ✅ No "Save password?" prompts
- ✅ Tests pass after 2nd, 3rd, 4th+ runs
- ✅ No manual Chrome intervention needed

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

1. ✅ `src/test/resources/boyka-config.json` - Updated
2. ✅ `scripts/disable_chrome_password_user.ps1` - Created
3. ✅ `CHROME_PASSWORD_FIX.md` - Detailed documentation
4. ✅ `CHROME_PASSWORD_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## 💡 Key Point

**Incognito Mode** is the primary solution:
- Fresh browser state for each test
- No password history
- No persistent data
- No alerts or warnings

Combined with the disabled Chrome features, this ensures clean test execution every time.

## 🆘 If Issues Persist

1. Verify config file was copied: `target/test-classes/boyka-config.json`
2. Close all Chrome instances before running tests
3. Run: `mvn clean test` (full clean build)
4. Check Chrome and ChromeDriver versions match
